# Simple-CLI-Chat
A project in which, thanks to OpenAI, the user can talk to a creative AI assistant and end the chat at any time by asking it to do so. 
This application template is easy to expand in order to extend the range of Python functions and enable them to be handled by AI. The chat can then ask for details containing arguments of specific functions from the interlocutor and respond using the results of the functions.
